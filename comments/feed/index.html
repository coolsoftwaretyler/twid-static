		<description><![CDATA[I really enjoyed listening to your program. I work for a peer based drug user organisation in Canberra, Australia called CAHMA as the Policy, Advocacy and Peer Support Worker. I was in Montreal and spoke at the INPUD Pre-Conference (International Network of People who Use Drugs) on Neoliberalism and the War on people use drugs.I was in the auditorium when the protest against the Canadian Health Minister took place. Whilst I agree completely with the need to hold politicians to account as one of the most marginalised communities you need to be very cautious about burning allies. A Healrh Minister taking decisions that she has (heroin program, new supervised injecting facilities etc) in Australia would be stunning. Our politicians continue to hide behind drug war propaganda and are simply pathetic.  I  produce a weekly 2 hour radio show entitled &quot;News from the Drug War Front&quot; on 2XX Canberra&#039;s Community Radio. The 2 XX website has &quot;audio on demand&quot; so you can listen to shows when it suits the listener. Thanks for your excellent program.]]></description>
